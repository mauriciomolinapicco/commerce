eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”
Functions: 
- Create Listing: Users are able to visit a page to create a new listing
- Active Listings Page: The default route of your web application lets users view all of the currently active auction listings
- Listing Page: Clicking on a listing takes users to a page specific to that listing. On that page, users are able to view all details about the listing, including the current price for the listing.
- Watchlist: Users who are signed in are able to visit a Watchlist page, which displays all of the listings that a user has added to their watchlist
- Categories: Users are able to visit a page that displays a list of all listing categories. Clicking on the name of any category takes the user to a page that displays all of the active listings in that category.
